OSMix THANKS file

OSMix has originally been conceived and created by Andreas Grapentin, for the
Operating Systems and Middleware Chair at Hasso Plattner Institute, University
of Potsdam, Germany. This file aims at listing all people who positively
supported the development of OSMix, for example by suggesting features,
pointing out problems, or contributing in any other way, ordered by the time
they first added to the project.
